Not all features may
be available or function properly.<br>
</p>
<p>pureLog is a MySQL database driven game-time analytics plugin
for PRoCon. Its primary function is to measure daily server popularity
by logging the collective total amount of time spent in-game by
players, designated as player-minutes. At the same time, pureLog is
capable of tracking the player-minutes of select users and can
differentiate between administrators and seeders if necessary.<br>
</p>
<p>This plugin was developed by analytalica and is currently a
PURE Battlefield exclusive.</p>
<p><big><b>What's New in pureLog 1.5+?</b></big></p>
<p>
<b>Instant On:</b> No more waiting around for
pureLog to get started launching. Disabling and re-enabling the plugin
immediately attempts a
new connection.<br>
<b>Speed Up:</b> The amount of original queries for
player-minute tracking sent by pureLog has nearly been cut in half.<br>
<b>Less Bugs:</b> Many bugs identified in pureLog 1.2 have
been fixed in 1.5+.<br>
<b>emptyTime:</b> Know how long the server at zero players is empty each day.</b>
</p>
<p><big><b>Initial Setup:</b></big><br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make a new MySQL database, or choose an existing one. I
recommend starting with a new database for organizational purposes.</li>
  <li>With the database selected, run the MySQL commands as
instructed below.</li>
  <li>Use an IP address for the hostname. </li>
  <li>The default port for remote MySQL
connections is 3306 (on PURE servers, use 3603).</li>
  <li>Set the database you want this plugin to connect to.
Multiple databases will be needed for multiple servers and plugins.</li>
  <li>Provide a username and password combination with the
permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER) necessary to
access that
database.</li>
  <li>The debug levels are as follows: 0
suppresses ALL messages (not recommended), 1 shows important messages
only (recommended), and 2 shows ALL messages (useful for step by step
debugging).</li>
  <li>Set the table names to the same names chosen in steps 1
and 2.</li>
  <ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><b>MySQL Commands:</b><br>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bigtable(id int NOT NULL
AUTO_INCREMENT, date varchar(255), min int(11), emptyTime int(11),
PRIMARY KEY (id));</li>
  <li>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daytable(id int NOT NULL
AUTO_INCREMENT, time varchar(255), min int(11), PRIMARY KEY (id));</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
Because the database name varies, you will need to manually
select it ('USE database_name') before running the queries.
</p>
<p><big><b>How it Works:</b></big></p>
<p>Every row in the Big Table stands for a different day, as
indicated by the timestamp found in the date column. The Big Table's
min column stores the total amount of minutes players spent in game
that day. On a 64-player server, there is a maximum of 60*24*64 = 92160
in-game minutes possible per day. The emptyTime column records the
amount of minutes the server is empty at zero players.</p>
<p>Every row in the Day Table stands for a different interval
(typically polled every minute), as indicated by the timestamp found in
the time column. The Day Table's min column stores the amount of
players recorded during that time interval. At the beginning of each
new day, the total sum of all the intervals is inserted into the Big
Table as an entry for the previous day, and then the Day Table is reset.</p>
<p><big><b>Troubleshooting: </b></big><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The IP address that Procon uses to access the MySQL
server
may be different from the IP of the layer itself. If a remote
connection
can't be established, try using more wildcards in the accepted
connections (do %.%.%.% to test).</li>
  <li>(Fixed as of pureLog 1.3.8) There is an error message
that
always appears when
initializing pureLog on a new database. It can be safely ignored and
should disappear in the next minute.</li>
</ul>
<p><big><b>Fallbacks: </b></big><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If at any step in the table updating process the
connection
fails, the plugin will continue adding minutes to the most recent day.
A new day for the plugin only begins when the connection is successful.
  </li>
  <li>On the case of a MySQL connection failure, the plugin
will
skip the next five insertion attempts to avoid overloading PRoCon and
the server.
Missing intervals will be summed up into one when a connection is
re-established.</li>
  <li>If an initial connection can't be established, the plugin
will try again once every minute. All error messages will be shown in
the console output with debug level set to 1.</li>
</ul>
